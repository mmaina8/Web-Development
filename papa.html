		<h1>LETTERS</h1>
			<p>
				Dear Papa,
				<br></br>
				It&#39;s been 12 years now, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it this far. I really miss you. There were times when all I could think of was you. Holding on to memories because that&#39;s all I have left. I remember how witty you were, lighting up every room you walked in to. It was us against the world. You were my &#39;dood dirl&#39; and I was yours. I miss you Papa. 
				<br></br>
				Countless times I find myself wondering how my life would be if you were here. So much was left unsaid and everything happened too fast. I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye, I didn&#39;t get to tell you I love you, to thank you for being the father figure you were to me. 
				I feel robbed, robbed of the experience I&#39;d have known of a life with you in it. 
				<br></br>

				Mom and Ivy miss you too. Sometimes I feel the hurt in their words each time we talk about you but I always try to be strong, for us all, just like you&#39;d have been. Mom tells me I&#39;m just like you. From my looks, to my witty personality and love for novels. I love that.
				<br></br>
				I&#39;m now 20 and boy, how I wish you&#39;d be here to see me grow. Life is tough out here. Sometimes I want to give up, knowing that if I do, I get to be with you. But I think of mom and Ivy, and I stay strong. I finished primary and high school, and now I&#39;m in college. I know you&#39;d be proud of me.
				<br></br>
				I thank God for how far he&#39;s brought me. As I&#39;m writing this, tears fall from my eyes. Not from a painful place, but from a hopeful place in my heart. I&#39;ve learnt so much from losing you and I hope one day I can use my story to inspire others. 
				I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll take me before I can say my story without bursting into tears, but I will get there.
				<br></br>
				I hope you know you&#39;re my hero and I love you so much.
