			<h2><strong>Role of Police</strong></h2>
				<p>In South Africa during the reign of apartheid, the union between a European and an African was illegal. Therefore the police enforced different ways in order to catch the law breakers.</p>
			    <p>Some of the police were to go around peeking through windows to see if they could catch anyone breaking the law. If an interracial couple got caught, they would kick down the door, drag the people out, beat them and arrest them. But they would only do that to the black person. The police would always favor the European (white) person and let them go scot-free while the African would pay the price.</p>
			    <p>Trevor describes South Africa as a police state. He defined it by saying that in the state, everyone thinks everyone else is the police. The police had recruited some people, in this case he specified that it was black people, who were acting as spies to aid the police in catching the law breakers. </p>
			    <p>He goes on to say that even when they were walking in the street with his mother, she would have to drop him as soon as the police came because they lived in an area that was highly populated by Europeans and they wouldn&#39;t have believed that she was his mother.</p>
			    <p>In the white areas you rarely saw the police and if you did it was officer friendly while in Soweto the police were an occupying army. They were militarized. Someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to be suppressed. Trevor says he&#39;d hear gunshots, screams and tear gas being fired into the crowds. The police would even take kids- the wrong color kids in the wrong color area. If you were black in a white people area, you were taken, and vice-versa.</p>


			<h2><strong>Role of Police in South Africa today</strong></h2>
				<p>The Constitution of South Africa lays down that the South African Police Service has a responsibility to prevent, combat and investigate crime, maintain public order, protect and secure the inhabitants of the Republic and their property, uphold and enforce the law, create a safe and secure environment for all people in South Africa, prevent anything that may threaten the safety or security of any community, investigate any crimes that threaten the safety or security of any community, ensure criminals are brought to justice and participate in efforts to address the causes of crime.</p>

			<h2><strong>Comparison with Police in Kenya</strong></h2>
				<p>There are some similarities with the police in Kenya. In Kenya, many times we see the police going after protesters in a violent manner. They are always heavily armed to suppress the protesters. Gunshots and tear gas is always fired into the crowds in an effort to control the crowd but instead it cultivates hate and anger between the people and the crowd.</p>
				<p>Albeit, the police in Kenya are friendly with the &#39;mwananchi&#39; (citizens) and not that many cases of arrests because of one&#39;s race have been reported.</p>
				<p>In the slums like Kibera, often you will find the police are heavily armed and are always on watch especially during times like the general elections but in the suburbs you rarely find the police harassing people for no reason. </p>
				<p>Also, corruption is rampant in Kenya and police have been caught up in many scandals surrounding corruption. It has become quite hard to trust the people who are supposed to be ensuring our safety because of such reasons.</p>
