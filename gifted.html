		<h1>GIFTED</h1>
			<p>
				I ran all the way home right after school. I had had enough, I had seen enough and I didn&#39;t know what was going on. &#39;Hey dear,&#39; my mom called out once I barged in. &#39;Hey mom&#39; I shouted back. I locked myself in my room, shoved my head in my pillow and sobbed. Things had not been okay.
				<br></br>
				It started three weeks ago when I was walking home from school. It all felt too familiar. I knew things were going to happen right when they did. I knew that a cat would run across the road right when it did, I knew I&#39;d meet Ms. Johnson right when I did and I knew she was going to ask me about my mom. It&#39;s like I was experiencing everything all over again.
				<br></br>
				I decided to ignore it and went on with my days as usual. But it didn&#39;t stop. Things got worse. I was literally living already knowing what would happen in the future. I didn&#39;t talk to anyone about it because I knew this wasn&#39;t just normal behavior. I knew that I&#39;d be judged, that I&#39;d lose all my friends. This was my problem and I had to deal with it on my own. Or so I thought.
				I woke up one day restless and tired. I had been tossing and turning the whole night because my visions wouldn&#39;t let me sleep. This time, they weren&#39;t the usual ones. 
				<br></br>
				I had visions about my mom, and they were horrifying. In an instance, I jumped out of bed and ran downstairs. &#39;Mom!&#39; I called out. When no one answered, I immediately fell to my knees. Had my visions come true? Was I too late to save my mom? I slowly crawled to the kitchen and stood there, dumbfounded at what was in front of me. 
				<br></br>
				My worst nightmare had come true.
