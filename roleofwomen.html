			<h1>Role and treatment of Women in Homegoing</h1>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						Chores- Chores were meant to be done by the woman. Some of the chores were cooking, taking care of the children, cleaning and fetching water. A woman was subordinate to her husband and could not go against his word. Like Baaba was told to watch over Effia and even though she didn&#39;t want to, she had to because Cobbe had told her to.</li>

						<br><li>Love- Maame was treated well by Big Man because he loved her very much. Big Man took her in even though she came from an unknown place with no family. Also, James treated Effia well because he loved her. Even though she tried to use black magic to get a child against his will, he did not abandon her. </br></li>

						<br><li>Mistreatment- The women who were slaves were mistreated by their seniors, who most of the time were male. Little Dove was brought in as a slave by Big Man and he is the one who beat her after he tested her by making her carry a pail of water one her head without dropping any of the water. The only reason he beat her was to keep up his image of being the &#39;Big Man.&#39; Esi was raped by one of the soldiers when she was in captivity. </br></li>

						<br><li>Bearing of children- Children were a sign of continuity in the family and women were expected to bear children or else they were seen as cursed. One of the reasons Effia was seen as cursed is because it was thought that she was barren.</br></li>

						<br><li>Source of income- Women were a source of income because once they were married off, their parents received their bride price. Effia&#39;s parents received a high bride price for her hand in marriage. Adowa was also married off after her parents received bride price.</br></li>
					</ol>

			<h1>Role and treatment of Women today.</h1>
				<p>In today&#39;s society, chores are not limited to women. Men can also do house chores and it is not tied down as a responsibility for women.
				<br>Women today are able to stand up for themselves and have even began a feminist movement that fights for equality and inclusion of the girl child in different places like the workplace or in school.</br>

				<br>Such movements have encouraged women to speak up when being mistreated or overlooked.</br>

				<br>Today, there are marriages that have no children entirely out of choice by the couple. This does not mean that they are cursed or barren. The traditional view of having no children is being lifted as sometimes not having children is purely out of choice.</br>
